------------------------------------------------- How to Use--------------------------------------------------------------
1. connect to a wifi network (you do not need to have internet access)
2. Ensure the sender and receiver are on the same wifi network
3. copy the ip-address of the wifi network into the "localhost". it should look something like 192.xx.xx.xx
4. Ensure both devices are on the same port address, by default it is 10565
5. copy the name of the file you want to send to --> file = "file name" in the code on the sender's side
6. Run the program using python client_side.py for the receiver and python server_side.py for the sender
7. Have fun sending... if that's something you normally do.
